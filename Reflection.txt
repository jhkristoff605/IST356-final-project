Reflection: Jordan Kristoff and Tejasdeep Vempa

This project was developed as a practical application of the concepts learned throughout the course, with a 
strong emphasis on usability, clarity, and real-world relevance. A central objective of the course was to design 
code that could be understood, reused, and interacted with by others, rather than functioning solely as a static 
script. To support this goal, the project was implemented as a web-based application using Streamlit, which enabled 
an intuitive and interactive user interface. By presenting the code through a live application, the project 
transformed abstract programming concepts into a tangible tool that users could actively explore, test, and learn 
from. For each format, there is a testing and design to ensure that the functions could work its own.

Important note: we decided to keep the two parts seperate due to the fact that thy



The application itself was structured around two complementary components that mirror common travel-planning 
workflows. The first component focused on route creation, allowing users to select multiple European cities and 
dynamically build a travel itinerary. Once the route was finalized, the application generated an interactive map 
visualizing the full journey and calculated distances between destinations. A downloadable CSV file was also produced, 
giving users the ability to save, review, or further analyze their itinerary outside of the application. This portion 
of the project reinforced skills related to data handling, geographic visualization, and user-driven logic.

The second component emphasized in-city exploration and personalization. Users could search within a chosen city and
apply category-based filters—such as restaurants, landmarks, or attractions—to dynamically update the map with 
relevant points of interest. The ability to save selected locations and export them as a downloadable file allowed 
users to experiment with different combinations and tailor results to their individual preferences. Overall, this 
project demonstrated how coding principles can be applied to create an end-to-end, user-focused application that 
integrates interactivity, data visualization, and practical utility, reinforcing both technical proficiency and 
thoughtful software design.
